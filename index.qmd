## We are creating webpages that are [primarily text and links]{.vonrestoff} {.center}

## Design webpages for <br> [consistency]{.vonrestoff} across platforms {.center .bigger}

## Good design is [accessible]{.vonrestoff} {.center}

## People don't read webpages.<br> They [scan]{.vonrestoff} {.center}

## How page structure affects scanability {.center}

##  {#slide9-id data-menu-title="Wall of text" .center}

If I write a labyrinthine wall of text in small font without white-space or much punctuation using really long sentences and perhaps some cumbersome jargon the page is much harder to read and the key information that the user is looking for is harder to find; And if I put the most important information about how things can be improved using bullets, chunks, informative headings, bolding, highlights and callouts down here, it's likely the user will click away without even trying to read it, let alone finding what they came for when presented with a web page structured like this.

## Making a webpage easier to scan {.center}

-   An informative heading, with the most important information at the top

-   Use chunks, bullets, [**bolding**]{.highlight}, [highlighting]{.vonrestoff} and

    <div>

    > callouts
    >
    > </div>

## Good web writing is<br>[easy to read and understand]{.vonrestoff} {.center}

## Writing by comparison {.center}

## Images, visuals and videos should be [used with caution]{.vonrestoff} {.center}
