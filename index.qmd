## We are creating webpages that are [primarily text and links]{.vonrestoff} {.center}

## Good design is [accessible]{.vonrestoff} {.center}

## People don't read webpages,<br>they [scan]{.vonrestoff} {.center}

## [Structure]{.vonrestoff} pages for ease of scanning {.center}

##  {#slide9-id .center data-menu-title="Wall of text"}

If I write a labyrinthine wall of text in small font without a heading, white-space or much punctuation using really long sentences and perhaps some cumbersome jargon the page is much harder to read and the key information that the user is looking for is harder to find; And if I put the most important information about how things can be improved using bullets, chunks, informative headings, bolding, highlights and callouts down here, it's likely the user will click away without even trying to read it, let alone finding what they came for when presented with a web page structured like this.

##  {#slide10-id .center}

::: {.callout-important .unnumbered title="Key points for webpage structure" icon="false"}
Put the most important information at the top. Use chunks with informative headings. Use short sentences and simple vocabulary.
:::

Use [**bolding**]{.highlight} and [highlighting]{.vonrestoff}.

-   Use bullets

## Subtraction Neglect Bias {#sec-subtraction-neglect-bias .center}

The bias towards adding instead of subtracting. 

Consider removing words, slides, sections, ingredients, commitments or activities as a way to improve things.
